# Javascript_TDD_Heroes
A JavaScript application developed using TDD describing a super hero with CRUD tasks and strength functionality

This Javascript application was built from scratch using TDD. The hero and food classes interact by adding to a 
hero's strength by giving them nourishment. Tasks are added and the the code keeps track of what tasks have has been
completed. This code was built to incorporate CRUD functionality into a Javascript app - this complements the CRUD code 
that has been developed in Ruby and Java with CodeClan.
